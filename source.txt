##### Buckler
A buckler, or target shield, is a small shield that can be passive as a forearm guard, or as an active deflection shield. While it is strapped to the arm, that hand is counted as open. The master's deflect sets them up for the perfect counter.

||
|:--|:--|
| Martial | If you wield a weapon in the same hand as the buckler, you suffer -2 to Attack rolls with it., If you are wielding only the buckler in your off hand, it has Deflect (d8).|
| Master | You only suffer -1 to attack for wielding a weapon with the buckler hand., You may add the deflect roll from the buckler to any deflect roll you make with your main hand, and if this roll reduces incoming damage to 0, you may immediately make an attack against your attacker as part of the same reaction. |

  ```
  ```

##### Skirmish 
Skirmish shields come in a variety of shapes but are about the size of the user's torso. You strap the shield to your forearm and grip it with your hand, or grasp it with a center grip, occupying your off hand. A Skirmish shield is large enough to provide better passive protection than the buckler, while still providing the agility missing with a tower shield. The Master can extend this agility to even spell attacks. 

||
|:--|:--|
| Martial | You gain an additional +2AC bonus against ranged weapon attacks, adding +4AC in total. |
| Master | You gain an additional +2AC bonus against ranged spell attacks, adding +4 in total, and a successful shove deals d4 + Strength modifier in bludgeoning damage. |



##### Tower
This massive shield is as tall as you and just as wide; you more fight around it like a door than moving it with your body, like carrying a piece of mobile cover. The master shieldman can take cover with his shield as quickly as a ranger uses trees, effectively giving the enemy no target. 

||
|:--|:--|
| Martial | You negate any flanking bonus an enemy might have on you. Additionally, you may use your reaction to gain half cover, possibly negating an attack, or granting you a bonus to your dexterity saving throw before you roll.|
| Master | While using the shield as cover, if you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a dexterity saving throw, and you fail that save, you take only half damage. |

### Feat: Ambush Weapons Master
- +1 to attack rolls with ambush weapons
- A successful hit to a creature that is surprised is a critical hit
- You may use your reaction to make a single attack against a creature that has missed you with a melee attack.

##### Punch Dagger
A punching blade is a small knife attached to a horizontal handle that projects out from the fist when held; but also includes wrist or fist mounted blades such as claws or daggers which extend out over the knuckles when equipped. A master takes any opening to attack with his main weapon and a quick punching stab at the same time.

| Master Perk | You have advantage on opportunity attacks made with this weapon. Additionally, if this weapon is in your off hand, you may make an opportunity attack with your main hand and this weapon. |

```
```

##### Whip Dagger
A dagger with a ring pommel at the end of a silk ribbon. The weapon can be used like a dagger in hand to attack creatures up to 5ft away, or swung about the end of the ribbon to attack creatures up to 10ft away. A master has learned the Scorpion Pull, an ability to impale a target and pull them closer with the attached ribbon.

##### Gauntlet
A guantlet is spiked or weighted knuckles or claws worn as a glove, however, heavy armor hands are not weighted enough to count. Putting on or taking off your gauntlets is an action, and they cannot be disarmed. A master's damage scales like Unarmed Strike, and can catch the enemy’s weapon on a miss, even attempting to bind and disarm the weapon in response to being hit. 

||
|:--|:--|
| Simple | One Handed, Melee d2 |
| Martial | One Handed, Melee d4 |
| Master | One Handed, Melee (table), Light |
| Master Perk | When you are hit with a melee attack, as a reaction before the damage, you can attempt a disarm attack. If you are successful, you take no damage, but if you are unsuccessful, you take damage as normal.|

##### Hidden Blade

This infamous weapon is a mechanical means to deploy a piercing dagger from under your wrist as part of an attack. The hand this weapon is equipped to is open to grapple or cast spells. However, you can’t deploy a hidden blade in a hand that is holding something else. This weapon cannot be disarmed but takes an action to equip or remove. A  master has mastered the surprise attack with this assassin's weapon.

The master can take full advantage of a surprise attack, ending a life as quickly as the battle starts. 

||
|:--|:--|
| Simple | One Handed, Melee d4, Awkward, Conceal, Finesse, Light |
| Martial | One Handed, Melee d4, Conceal, Finesse, Light |
| Master | One Handed, Melee d4, Conceal, Finesse, Light |
| Master Perk | Any hit against a surprised creature takes maximum damage from this weapon and any attachers such as sneak attack, instead of rolling for the damage. |



##### Interceptor

Interceptor is a generic term for any article of clothing which is used to deflect or intercept attacks, such as a thick wool cloak, silk scarf, war fan or umbrella. These are not weapons in the traditional sense, just durable personal effects, but can be just as effective in a duel as steel. While you may wear an interceptor as clothing, to use it, it must be equipped in your hand

Wielding an interceptor gives you +1 AC in addition to the effects below. The master can use an interceptor to catch missile weapons before they strike, even for an ally.

||
|:--|:--|
|Simple| You cannot wield an interceptor with simple training. 
|Martial| One Handed, Conceal, Deflect (d8), Finesse, Light|
|Master|One Handed, Conceal, Deflect (d8), Disarm, Entangle, Finesse, Light, Trip|
|Master Perk| You may use the Deflect property against ranged weapons. When a creature you can see attacks a target that is within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on the attack roll.|

```
```

##### Knuckle Axe
Designed much like brass knuckles, but with a blade that sweeps back toward the forearm, over the side of the fist. The knuckle axe resembles an axe head with no handle, and either 4 finger holes or a curved handle to rest inside a closed fist. Masters with knuckle axes learn to slash through soft targets much like a real axe, attacking two targets at once. 

||
|:--|:--|
| Simple | One Handed, Melee d4, Awkward, Light |
| Martial | One Handed, Melee d6, Deflect, Light |
| Master | One Handed, Melee d6, Deflect, Light |
| Master Perk | When you score a critical hit, make an additional melee attack to another creature adjacent to you as part of the same action. |

##### Side Baton
Often called a Tonfa, Riot Baton, or Arm Club, the Side Baton is a defensive weapon designed for deflecting attacks with one's own forearm. It is a stout club with a perpendicular handle attached a third of the way down the length, allowing it to be swing out for a swipe, or extend the reach of a thrust. A master may also flip the side baton and grab it by the long end to use the handle as a hook in combat.

||
|:--|:--|
| Simple | One Handed, Melee d4, Light |
| Martial | One Handed, Melee d6, Deflect, Light |
| Master | One Handed, Melee d8, Deflect, Light, Trip |
| Master Perk | Your deflect roll is 2d10, rather than d8, and you may add your proficiency to this roll. |


<div class='pageNumber auto'></div>
<div class='footnote'>AMBUSH WEAPONS</div>

##### Unarmed Strikes
A creature with simple training can throw basic punches that are largely ineffective, while a creature with martial training can properly land punches and kicks, doing small amounts of damage. A master of unarmed strikes is as well trained as a traditional monk, though lacking the ki focus and mysticism the monk possesses. Your damage scales according to your proficiency bonus on to the table below. 

Your unarmed strikes do not count as weapon attacks until you have master training with them.

### Feat: Axe Master
- +1 to attack rolls with axes
- On your turn, when you score a critical hit or reduce a target to 0 hit points with an axe, you can make another attack as part of the same action. This effect can happen multiple times as long as the criteria are met. 
- Before you make a melee attack, you can choose to take a -5 penalty to the attack roll. If the attack hits, you add +10 to the attack's damage. 
- You count as one size category larger for the purpose of weapon properties, such as trip or disarm. 

##### Battle Axe 

This is an axe about 2ft-3ft in length, with a longer beard designed for a wider slashing wound. This weapon is large enough to use with two hands for more powerful strikes, yet nimble enough to be used in one hand. Masters with the battle axe get more reliable damage out of the weapon.

|:--|:--|
| Simple | Two Handed, Melee d8, Awkward |

| Master | One Handed, Melee d10,Trip, Versatile d12|
|Master Perk|Reroll a damage dice result of 1 or 2 for both weapon damage and any attachers such as Smite.|

##### Greataxe
The greataxe is the classic barbarian axe but also includes more historical versions such as the bardiche, voulge, or Dane axe. The greataxe has incredible potential for damage, and the master greataxe wielder can fell even the stoutest of foes with reliability not seen in many other weapon styles.

||
|:--|:--|
| Simple | Two Handed, Melee d10, Awkward, Heavy |
| Martial | Two Handed, Melee d12, Disarm, Heavy, Trip |
| Master | Two Handed, Melee 2d8, Disarm, Heavy, Trip |
| Master Perk | When you roll at least 5 higher than the enemy's AC, you can roll all damage and any attachers such as elemental damage twice and take the better result.|

##### Halberd
The halberd consists of an axe blade topped with a spike mounted on an 8ft long shaft. It has a hook on the back side of the axe blade for grappling mounted combatants. With at least martial proficiency, a halberd can be used to perform a trip against mounted foes to pull them from the saddle to a prone position, and the master has advantage on this maneuver. Additionally, a master can entangle, but not trip, a creature up to two category sizes larger than them.

||
|:--|:--|
| Simple | Two Handed , Melee d10, Awkward, Brace, Heavy |
| Martial | Two Handed, Melee 2d6, Brace, Heavy, Reach, Trip |
| Master | Two Handed, Melee 3d4, Brace, Entangle, Heavy, Reach, Trip |
| Master Perk | You gain advantage on trip attacks made to mounted enemies and Large creatures. If your trip is successful against a mounted foe, it is automatically pulled from its mount to a prone position. You gain advantage on entangle attacks made against enemies two size categories larger than you.|

##### Handaxe
An incredibly versatile weapon and tool, the hand axe can be thrown, or used in melee, and can be used to trip your foe. The master learns the ability to bind and disarm. 

||
|:--|:--|
| Simple | One Handed, Melee d6, Thrown (10/30) |
| Martial | One Handed, Melee d6, Thrown (20/60), Light, Trip |
| Master | One Handed, Melee d6, Thrown (20/60), Disarm, Light, Trip |
| Master Perk | You gain advantage on all disarm attacks.|

##### Hook Sword
The hook sword is an exotic weapon made famous by the northern Chinese masters. It is a shortsword length weapon in which the tip forms a prominent hook, and which the knuckle guard features a crescent shaped blade. A hook sword can easily catch weapons and limbs, giving it superior control over an enemy's movements.

The master can also hook with another hook sword for a unique means of trapping and binding enemies, as well as striking further by forming a makeshift flail; letting go of one hook sword and swinging it by the hook of the other sword you are currently holding. 

||
|:--|:--|
| Simple | One Handed, Melee d6, Awkward |
| Martial | One Handed, Melee d6, Deflect, Disarm, Finesse, Light, Trip |
| Master | One Handed, Melee d6, Deflect, Disarm, Finesse, Light, Entangle, Lunge, Trip|
| Master Perk | When you are hit with a melee weapon attack, as a reaction you can make a disarm or entangle attack against that enemy. While dual wielding two hook swords, you have reach and a lunge does not use your reaction.|


```
```

##### Khopesh
This axe sword hybrid was made famous by ancient Egyptians. It is a sword built with a large crescent shaped protrusion about one third from the tip, and a hooked tip, forming a sort of question mark shape. It acts similarly to a battle axe, but is lighter and can more reliably cut with a larger surface area. A Master with the Khopesh has learned to use the hooked point to drag or trip enemies to the ground with ease.

||
|:--|:--|
| Simple | One Handed, Melee d8, Awkward, Disarm |
| Martial | One Handed, Melee 2d4, Disarm, Light, Trip |
| Master | One Handed, Melee 2d4, Disarm, Light, Trip |
| Master Perk | When you make a trip attack, if you hit, even if they save against the attempt, your enemy's speed is reduced by 10ft until the end of their next turn. While they have this penalty, they have disadvantage saving throws against a trip attack. |


##### Poleaxe
A Poleaxe is an infantry weapon designed for use against armored foes. It is characterized by an axe on one side and a hammer on the other, while tipped with a dagger-like spike from the top. It is typically on a 6 ft haft, shod with iron to protect it from damage. Though not long enough for a reach weapon, its style resembles that of a quarterstaff and axe combined. A master learns to use the weapon's iron shodding more actively, blocking attacks that would normally chop through the wood shaft.

||
|:--|:--|
| Simple | Two Handed, Melee d10, Awkward, Heavy |
| Martial | Two Handed, Melee d10, Brace, Deflect, Heavy, Penetrate, Trip |
| Master | Two Handed, Melee 2d6, Brace, Deflect, Heavy, Penetrate, Trip |
| Master Perk | While wielding a poleaxe, you gain +1 AC and you may add your proficiency bonus to deflect rolls.|

##### Tomahawk
The Tomahawk was invented and made famous by indigenous North Americans, and featured a slimmer blade more balanced for throwing, and an opposing spike or small hammer so that even if the axe blade missed, there was still a chance the weapon could deal some damage. 

Tomahawks are balanced for throwing further distances than any other axe, and the master has learned to throw them with great force, using the hammer or spike's weight to drive the thinner axe head deeper into a target. 

||

| Simple | One Handed, Melee d4, Awkward, Thrown (10/30) |

| Master | One Handed, Melee d4, Thrown (40/120), Disarm, Finesse, Light, Trip |
| Master Perk | You can choose to take a -5 penalty to a ranged attack roll. If the attack hits, you add +10 to the attack's damage.|

</div>

### Feat: Bludgeon Master
- +1 to attack rolls made with bludgeons
- When you score a critical hit, your enemy must succeed on a Constitution Saving Throw or be stunned until the end of your next round
- If you deal more damage in a single attack than the enemy's AC, the enemy must succeed on a constitution saving throw or take a level of exhaustion. You may grant two levels of exhaustion per enemy in this way. 

##### Greatclub
The greatclub is simply a heavy, two-handed club, though it can be refined like the Japanese Tetsubo. A master of the greatclub can render a weapon nearly useless.

||
|:--|:--|
| Simple | Two Handed, Melee d8, Heavy |
| Martial | Two Handed, Melee d8, Disarm, Penetrate, Heavy |
| Master | Two Handed, Melee d10, Deflect, Disarm, Penetrate, Heavy |
| Master Perk | If you are successful in a disarm attempt, the enemy can no longer add proficiency to <br>attacks with that weapon. |

##### Heavy Club
A heavy club is a larger mass weapon, much <br>like a bat or ball mace. A master can target <br>the foe's head more easily, giving stuns<br> that the opponent can't shake off as quickly. 

||
|:--|:--|
| Simple | Two Handed, Melee d6|
| Martial | One Handed, Melee d6,<br> Thrown (10/30) |

| Master Perk | When you score a critical hit, <br>your enemy is stunned for d4 <br>rounds. At the end of each of<br> its turns, your stunned enemy<br> can attempt a Constitution<br> saving throw, ending the<br> effect on a success. |

##### Light Club
A light club might be a simple sap or a metal bar, and many clubs designed for combat are designed to be thrown. A master learns to be extremely accurate to a foe's head and knock them off balance. 

||
|:--|:--|
| Simple | One Handed, Melee d4, Conceal, Finesse, Light |
| Martial | One Handed, Melee d4, Conceal, Thrown (20/60), Finesse, Light |
| Master | One Handed, Melee d6, Conceal, Thrown (20/60), Finesse, Light |
| Master Perk | On hit, you can choose to deal only your Strength modifier in damage but your foe must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or suffer disadvantage to its Saving Throws until the end of your next turn.  |


##### Bar Mace
A bar mace is a stout iron bar lined with spikes or flanges to increase its damage and threat. Designed for low skilled military soldiers, a master with the bar mace has learned to use the weight and odd angles to pry weapons from their enemy's hands, or ruin them in the process.

||
|:--|:--|
| Simple | Two Handed, Melee d6, Disarm |
| Martial | One Handed, Melee d8, Disarm|
| Master | One Handed, Melee d8, Deflect, Disarm |
| Master Perk | If you successfully Disarm, your enemy has disadvantage on melee attacks. At the end of its turn, it can attempt a Constitution saving throw, ending this effect on a success. You can apply this effect to any creature on a success regardless of if it is wielding a weapon.|



##### Flanged Mace
A mace is made up of a metal head with small bladed protrusions, attached to a simple wooden or metal shaft, designed specifically to hammer and shred armored enemies. This weapon deals slashing and bludgeoning damage at the same time, for the purpose of overcoming resistances or immunities. Masters with maces learn to punch through armor to damage those foes with ease.

||
|:--|:--|
| Simple | One Handed, Melee d6|
| Martial | One Handed, Melee d6, Light, Penetrate|
| Master | One Handed, Melee d8, Light, Penetrate|
| Master Perk | Your penetrate affects creatures in any armor. You may also add your strength modifier twice to Penetrate damage totals. |

```
```

##### Mallet
A mallet is typically a crafter's tool, but can be repurposed for war. It consists of a wood haft inset within a large wooden cylinder. The wood construction means the mallet can be wide and soft, allowing for creative attacks in combat. A master can use the lightness of a mallet for a quick strike that sends the enemy reeling.

||
|:--|:--|
| Simple | One Handed, Melee d8, Light|
| Martial | One Handed, Melee d8, Thrown (20/60), Disarm, Light|
| Master | One Handed, Melee d8, Thrown (30/90), Disarm, Light  |
| Master Perk | As a bonus action, you can make a shove attempt which, if successful, deals bludgeoning damage equal to your strength modifier. |

##### Morningstar
This is an infantry weapon in the form of a thick wooden shaft up to 8 feet in length, slightly fluted toward the top, with a spiked head and topped with a stout iron spike. This weapon deals piercing  and bludgeoning damage at the same time, for the purpose of overcoming resistances or immunities. A master with a morning star can absolutely ruin armor, rendering it less effective for its wearer. 

||
|:--|:--|
| Simple | Two Handed, Melee d8|
| Martial | Two Handed, Melee d10, Brace, Penetrate, Reach |
| Master | Two Handed, Melee d12, Brace, Double Ended d4, Penetrate, Reach |
| Master Perk |As an action, you can try to ruin the protective qualities of your enemy's armor, even if it is Natural Armor. Before you roll an attack, you can choose to take a -5 to the roll. On hit, you deal piercing damage equal to your strength modifier, but reduce the enemy's AC by the same amount.|


##### Quarterstaff
The simple staff is a useful Double Ended bludgeoning weapon, whether shod and weighted like the English quarterstaff, or simply made of strong bamboo, like the Japanese bo. A master learns to to strike with both ends as fast as a lesser trained combatant can with one end. 

||
|:--|:--|
| Simple | Two Handed, Melee d6|
| Martial | Two Handed, Melee d8, Double Ended d6 |
| Master | Two Handed, Melee d8, Double Ended d8 |
| Master Perk | You gain +1 AC while wielding this weapon. Additionally, you may use Double Ended when making an Opportunity Attack, making two attacks instead of one. |

| Sling | Bludgeoning |d4|d4|d6|0|0.1|
| Wrist Shot | Bludgeoning or Slashing |d4|d6|d6|1|5|

</div>

### Feat: Bow and Sling Master
- Attacking at long range doesn't impose disadvantage on your ranged weapon attack rolls.
- Your attacks ignore half and three quarters cover
- You can overdraw your shot, making the shot less accurate, but more powerful. Before you make a ranged attack with a ranged weapon with which you are proficient, you can choose to take a -5 penalty to the attack roll. If you do so and the attack hits, it deals +10 damage. 

##### Bladed Bow
A bladed bow has two curved blades affixed to its limbs. Though not nearly as stout as a quarterstaff due to the flexibility of the bow itself, it is nonetheless an easy way to protect yourself when the enemy closes. The bladed bow is very specialized and requires dedicated training to be anything but clumsy.  In the hands of a master, the bladed bow is as dangerous as a dual wielder.

| Master | Two Handed, Ranged d8 (120/600), Melee d6, Double Ended d6, Finesse, Heavy |
| Master Perk | As a bonus action, you may choose the Disengage action.|

```
```
##### Compound Bow
A compound bow is about the size of a shortbow, but consists of two pulleys on its steel limbs which allow the user to load exponentially more force. Because of the added mechanical aspect, loading is a bit slower than loading a longbow. But, its stopping power punches like a Greatbow. A master with the Compound can overdraw the impressive power of the Compound for devastating effect.

| Martial | Two Handed, Ranged d10 (200/800), Penetrate, Reload Object Interaction|
| Master | Two Handed, Ranged d12 (200/800), Penetrate, Reload Part of Attack|
| Master Perk | When you overdraw, you take the normal -5 to attack, but if you hit, you deal damage to your primary target, and one other target in a straight line from you that intersects your first target. |

##### Greatbow
A greatbow is a bow much taller and stouter than the longbow, and fires specialized great arrows that are similar in size to a javelin. Due to its size, javelins and ballista bolts can be used as ammunition, but with disadvantage on the attack. Greatbow masters have learned to overdraw the stout poundage, sending enemies flying back. You must have a Strength score of at least 13 to wield a Greatbow.

| Simple | Two Handed, Ranged d10 (100/500), Awkward, Heavy |
| Martial | Two Handed, Ranged d10 (200/800), Heavy, Trip |
| Master | Two Handed, Ranged d12 (200/800), Heavy, Trip |
| Master Perk | When you score a critical hit, your enemy must succeed on a strength saving throw or be shoved 5ft in a straight line away from you and knocked prone. Large creatures have advantage on this save, and larger creatures are immune. Creatures that are flying have disadvantage on this save. |

##### Longbow
A longbow has a larger power stroke than a shortbow, meaning the arrow is drawn further and has a higher draw weight. This, combined with the larger size, usually 5ft-6ft long, mean the bow is much more powerful, but perhaps a bit more cumbersome in close combat and atop a mount. A master with a longbow has learned to steady his aim and ignore all distractions impeding accuracy.

| Martial | Two Handed, Ranged d8 (120/600), Heavy |
| Master | Two Handed, Ranged d10 (120/600), Heavy |
| Master Perk | If you suffer disadvantage for any reason, you can use your reaction to attempt a concentration check against DC10 or half your target's AC, whichever is higher. If you succeed, your disadvantage is negated. |


##### Recurve
A recurve bow is usually shorter, in the 3ft-4ft range, but has a greater power stroke than a bow of its size. Due to the shorter overall size but higher draw, the master can load an extra arrow into the recurve and attack two different targets, though with far less accuracy than one.

||

| Martial | Two Handed, Ranged 2d4 (120/600)|
| Master | Two Handed, Ranged 2d4 (120/600)|
| Master Perk | You can loose two arrows at the same time. You must choose two targets within your normal range that are within 5 ft of one another, but may attack each target separately with the same attack. These attacks suffer disadvantage that cannot be removed.  |

```
```
##### Shortbow
A short bow is about 3 feet in length and usually very portable. It is more suited to close combat, as its smaller size lends itself to agile movement and quick targeting on either side of the body. 

||
|:--|:--|
| Simple | Two Handed, Ranged d6 (60/240) |
| Martial | Two Handed, Ranged d6 (80/320) |
| Master | Two Handed, Ranged d8 (80/320)|
| Master Perk | You threaten 5ft around you and can make a ranged opportunity attack when an enemy leaves your threatened space. You do not have disadvantage to ranged attacks if an enemy is within 5ft of you.  |


##### Sling
A sling is a simple leather cup with cords that allow the user to launch rounded bullets with circular momentum. One of the oldest ranged weapons known, it is both simple and effective at delivering a crushing blow at medium range. You can use rounded stones or small bits of anything that can fit into the leather cup, though these attacks are made with -1 to the attack roll. A master learns to over swing, instead of over drawing, and can disable and disorient an enemy with precise stones to the head.

| Martial | One Handed, Conceal, Disarm, Ranged d4 (30/120) |
| Master | One Handed, Conceal, Disarm, Entangle, Melee d6, Ranged d6 (30/120), Light, Trip |
| Master Perk | You can take -5 to the attack roll to hurl with extra strength, and on hit, the target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or have disadvantage to attacks until the end of its next turn.|


##### Wrist Shot
Using stretchable or spring loaded materials, the wrist shot shoots rounded bullets much like a sling, though uses the power of elasticity of the material rather than gathered circular momentum. Because of this added stability in flight, you may also use flat, bladed disks as ammunition. You can use debris or rounded stones as ammunition, but this causes a -1 penalty to your attack roll. Masters with wrist shots can bounce shots around corners and off hard surfaces to attack unseen enemies in cover. 

||
|:--|:--|
| Simple | Two Handed, Ranged d4 (40/160), Awkward |
| Martial | Two Handed, Ranged d4 (40/160), Disarm |
| Master | Two Handed, Ranged d6 (40/160), Disarm |
| Master Perk | You can measure distance from yourself to a single DM approved obstacle, and then to your target. If that range is within your long distance, you can ignore any cover the enemy has. You can bounce twice, but this attack is made with disadvantage. |

### Feat: Combat Blade Master
- +1 to attack rolls with combat blades
- On your turn, you can use your reaction to assume a parrying stance. Until your next turn or until you are no longer holding a Combat Blade, you gain a +2 to your AC against melee weapon or melee spell attacks that target you.
- You have advantage on opportunity attacks


##### Bastard Sword
The Bastard Sword is the child of the Longsword and the Greatsword, a weapon in length between the two that uses techniques from either parent. A master of the Bastard Sword learns to deal greater damage against larger targets, using the weapon’s leverage to create more powerful strikes, and also some deft precision with the tip much like a Longsword. 

||
|:--|:--|
| Simple | Two Handed, Melee d10, Awkward, Heavy |
| Martial | Two Handed, Melee d12, Heavy |
| Master | One Handed, Melee d12, Heavy, Versatile 2d6 |
| Master Perk | Your Critical hit range is 19-20, unless it is 18-20. Against category size Large and larger enemies, your damage is 2d8(2d10) instead of d12(2d6).|


##### Broadsword
True broadswords have a wider, thicker blade to add power to the blow, and often have a single edge to give more weight to the blade, like the Falchion, Messer, Seax, or Chinese Dadao. Because of this the weapon performs much like an axe in the strike. A master learns to strike truer, dealing more damage to soft targets.

##### Greatsword

The greatsword is often as tall as its wielder, spanning in the 5ft-6ft range with a 2ft handle. The long blade, wide handle, and added weight make the greatsword one of the most damaging melee weapons in use, and can easily dispatch larger monsters with ease.  A master finds the greatest weapon to use against a large enemy is the greatsword. 

||
|:--|:--|
| Simple | Two Handed, Melee 2d6, Awkward, Heavy |
| Martial | Two Handed, Melee 2d8, Heavy|
| Master | Two Handed, Melee 2d10, Heavy|
| Master Perk | Against category size Large and larger enemies, your damage is 2d12, instead of 2d10. |

##### Katana
The Katana, made famous by the Japanese, is a single edged, slightly curved sword with a minimal guard called a tsuba and a longer handle than western or middle eastern swords. The longer handle and curved edge provide different leverage and more effective deflections. A master can dual wield with a Katana deflecting two attacks, or with two hands to a single katana, deflect even powerful blows with ease.

||

| Simple | Two Handed, Melee d6, Awkward |
| Martial | One Handed, Melee d6, Finesse, Light, Versatile d8|
| Master | One Handed, Melee d8, Deflect, Finesse, Light, Versatile d10 |
| Master Perk | While wielding this weapon with two hands, your deflect dice becomes 2d10. With one hand, you may add your proficiency bonus to your deflect rolls.|

##### Longsword
The longsword is a multipurpose cutting and thrusting weapon, with a wide guard for dueling, and includes the cruciform fencing sword, along with similar western european weapons. Generally, the blade is between 3ft-4ft, with a 10"-12" handle. Masters learn to become more rapier-like with the point, and with increased weight of this weapon, learn devastating blows at critical strikes. 

||
|:--|:--|
| Simple | Two Handed, Melee d8, Awkward |
| Martial | One Handed, Melee d8, Disarm, Versatile d10 |
| Master | One Handed, Melee d10, Disarm, Finesse, Versatile d12|
| Master Perk | Your Critical hit range is 18-20.|



```
```

##### Montante
The Montante was a type of greatsword made famous by western Europeans, prized for its reach and seen as the perfect weapon against multiple assailants. It is similar in length to a polearm, has similar reach and can even use similar techniques thanks to a smaller handle above the crossguard called a ricasso, just without the ability to brace as many polearms do. The Master has learned to use the parrying hooks to great effect, keeping themselves safe from attacks with clever use of the guard. 

||
|:--|:--|
| Simple | Two Handed, Melee 2d6, Awkward, Heavy |
| Martial | Two Handed, Melee 2d6, Heavy, Reach |
| Master | Two Handed, Melee 3d6, Heavy, Reach |
| Master Perk | You have +1 AC while wielding this weapon, and you negate any flanking bonus any enemy might have for flanking you or having the enemy's ally near you, such as pack tactics or sneak attack. |


##### Scimitar
A single-handed, curved sword, similar in dimension to the longsword.  Unfortunately, unlike the longsword, the scimitar is usually fitted with a handle too small to allow two-handed wielding, but the master learns to use the curve as a means to deflect and is an expert at using the curve while mounted.


||
|:--|:--|
| Simple | One Handed, Melee d6, Awkward |
| Martial | One Handed, Melee d6, Finesse, Light |
| Master | One Handed, Melee d8, Deflect, Finesse, Light |
| Master Perk | When you choose to deflect, you may roll twice and take the better result. Additionally, if you travel at least 20ft before you make an attack, your weapon deals an additional d8 slashing damage for one attack. To deal this extra damage again, you must travel an additional 20 feet, choosing the same or different target. |


##### Short Glaive
A short glaive is a glaive weapon with a shorter handle, usually in the range of length of a greatsword, but much lighter as the metal blade is smaller and most of the weapon is wooden haft. A short glaive is favored among elven armies as an effective long weapon that is both heavy hitting and light enough to use with finesse. Masters of the short glaive find the weapon can swing through soft targets, converting the momentum into another attack if they’re lucky. 

||

| Simple | Two Handed, Melee d8, Awkward |
| Martial | Two Handed, Melee 2d4, Finesse, Lunge |
| Master | Two Handed, Melee 2d4, Brace, Finesse, Lunge |
| Master Perk | If an enemy misses you with a melee attack, you can use your reaction to make a melee attack against that enemy.  |

### Feat: Crossbow Master
- If a target is within 10ft of you, you can choose another target within your crossbow's normal range in a straight line from you through your first target, and to the second. If you hit the closer target, you can also roll to attack the further target for free, hitting both targets with the same piece of ammunition.
- Being within 5ft of a hostile creature does not impose disadvantage on your ranged weapon attack rolls.
- When you have advantage on an attack, you may roll 3d20, instead of 2, and take the most favorable result.









> ##### Reload Times
> Remember reload times from fastest to slowest: Part of Attack, Object Interaction, Reaction, Bonus, Attack, Action.
>
> Also remember you can reload with any action slower than what is listed, i.e. if you can reload with a Reaction, you can choose to instead reload with a Bonus Action

##### Blowgun
Blowguns are used to deliver <br>poison from a distance, as the <br>needle-like dart is often too small <br>to cause serious damage. They are <br>nearly silent when shot, and do not <br>reveal your location if you attack from stealth and miss. A blowgun can be shot with one hand but requires two to reload. A master uses the art of the flying viper, shooting two shots at once, and reloading with a single hand. 

||

| Martial | One Handed, Ranged d2 (25/100), Reload <br>Part of Attack, Light  |
| Master | One Handed, Ranged d4 (25/100), Light, Reload Part of Attack, Light  |
| Master Perk | You can load two darts. Roll two attacks <br>against the same target. Each dart <br>deals d2 damage and applies their<br> effect to the target, but you can <br>only do this at your normal range. |


##### Hand Crossbow
A hand crossbow is a hand drawn bow released with a pistol trigger. The limbs are weaker than most other crossbows, and can only launch the bolt a short distance, but being able to pull the drawstring back without mechanical assistance means it can be reloaded very quickly. A master can reload one-handed using hook points on the bolt case, enabling them to dual wield hand crossbows if they wished.

||
|:--|:--|
| Simple | One Handed, Ranged d6+1 (20/60), Light, Reload Reaction |
| Martial | One Handed, Ranged d6+1 (30/120) Light, Reload Object Interaction |
| Master | One Handed, Ranged d6+1 (30/120) Light, Reload Part of Attack |
| Master Perk | Can be reloaded with one hand. As a bonus action, you can make an attack with this weapon, even if you haven't taken the attack action. |

##### Heavy Crossbow
Heavy crossbows load over a thousand pounds of force, allowing it to punch targets like a knight's lance. Because of this power, you must draw a heavy crossbow by turning a winch to pull the drawstring back. A master arbalist uses the crossbow's power to knock hard targets prone or flying creatures from the sky.

||
|:--|:--|
| Simple | Two Handed, Ranged d10+3 (50/200), Heavy, Penetrate, Reload Action |
| Martial | Two Handed, Ranged d10+3 (100/400), Heavy, Penetrate, Reload Attack, Trip|
| Master | Two Handed, Ranged d10+3 (100/400), Heavy, Penetrate, Reload Bonus, Trip |
| Master Perk | Before you roll an attack, you can choose to take -5 to the roll. If you hit, your enemy must succeed on a strength saving throw or be knocked prone. Category Large creatures gain advantage on this save, while larger creatures are immune. Flying creatures suffer disadvantage on this save while flying.  |

##### Hidden Crossbow
This mechanical, wrist-mounted crossbow, is similar to a hidden blade. The hand this weapon is equipped to is open, however, you can’t deploy a hidden crossbow from a hand that is holding something. This weapon cannot be disarmed, but takes 1 action to equip or remove. The master can launch a bolt in melee with the slightest distraction. 

||
|:--|:--|
|Simple| One Handed, Ranged d4 (10/30) Awkward, Conceal, Light, Reload Attack
|Martial| One Handed, Ranged d4 (20/40) Conceal, Light, Reload Bonus
|Master| One Handed, Ranged d4 (30/60) Conceal, Light, Reload Reaction
|Master Perk| If an enemy misses you with an attack, you can use your reaction to make a ranged attack against it.| 

##### Light Crossbow
You draw a light crossbow back by pulling a lever. A master learns to move and shoot with the light crossbow so efficiently he can reactively shoot moving targets at melee range, threatening all squares near him as if he had a melee weapon. 

Light Crossbows can be made into **Repeating Crossbows** which hold 6 crossbow bolts. As long as it holds bolts, you can reload it by pulling the reloading lever (part of the attack action). Loading a new case of 6 bolts takes an action (regardless of your level of training) that provokes an Opporutnity Attack.  

||
|:--|:--|
| Simple | Two Handed, Ranged d8+2 (40/200), Reload Attack |
| Martial | Two Handed, Ranged d8+2 (80/320), Reload Reaction |
| Master | Two Handed, Ranged d8+2 (80/320), Reload Object Interaction |
| Master Perk | You threaten 5ft around you and can make a ranged opportunity attack if an enemy leaves your threatened space.  |

##### Mauler
A crossbow with two bows mounted in an X shape, the drawstring is attached to a triangle mechanism that holds 3 bolts at once, but adds to its reload time. Even with two bows, the three bolts fly with less power than a hand crossbow and don’t group well at distance, but up close has incredible stopping power. Masters group the bolts at weak points with devastating effect. 

As the bolts spread over distance, on medium or smaller size targets outside normal range the damage is only d4, as only the top bolt is on target. Large and larger size targets take all bolts at any range.

||
|:--|:--|
| Simple | Two Handed, Ranged 3d4 (20/50) Awkward, Penetrate, Reload Action |
| Martial | Two Handed, Ranged 3d4 (30/60), Penetrate, Reload Attack |
| Master | Two Handed, Ranged 3d4 (40/80), Penetrate, Reload Bonus |
| Master Perk |  When you score a critical within normal range, roll 6d4 for your bonus critical damage.  |


##### Portable Ballista
This small siege weapon takes a while to reload but the punch is worth the wait. It provides several thousand pounds of force to a javelin which punches through even the toughest armor.  Masters use flanking surfaces to nail a target to walls and trees with ease.

A deployable stand can be purchased to mount the weapon. As an action, the weapon is mounted to the stand and can be reloaded as an object interaction.

| Master | Two Handed, Ranged d12+4 (150/600), Heavy, Entangle, Penetrate, Reload Bonus, Trip |
| Master Perk | The crossbow mastery two-target range is 50ft. Additionally, your Entangle attacks add the restrained condition if successful, as you pin your target to the ground or surrounding terrain features.|

##### Spinner
This gnomish invention launches discus blades with internal mechanisms instead of tension limbs. It holds 20 blades and reloading is part of the attack, though when depleted, it takes an Action to reload with 20 more. Range can be measured to an obstacle, then your target. If less than normal range, ignore any cover the creature has. Masters can richochet the blade off one target's weak spot into another nearby.

| Martial | One Handed, Ranged 2d4 (30/120), Disarm, Light |
| Master | One Handed, Ranged 2d4 (30/120), Disarm, Light |
| Master Perk |On critical hit, the blade bounces off its target and hits another target of your choice within 10ft of the first target, dealing only weapon damage. |

### Feat: Dueling Blade Master
- +1 to attack rolls with dueling blades
- If a creature within 5ft of you takes an attack action against another creature other than you, you may use your reaction to attack that creature.
- On your turn, if you land a critical hit, you can use your reaction to take another attack action with your dueling blade. 

##### Dagger
Any blade about forearm length and smaller can be called a dagger, and there are as many styles of daggers as there are cultures in existence. Nearly all daggers are weapons of opportunity, but some devote their lives to the style. The master can make blinding fast attacks even while they <br>focus their attention elsewhere.

| Master Perk | You can use a bonus action to make<br> an attack with a dagger, even if you <br>don't take the attack action. |


##### Kukri
A wider, tip heavy blade which curves toward the cutting <br>edge like a sickle, rather than away from it like a scimitar. A kukri's weight and shape mean that it performs more like a handaxe than a dagger, and can be thrown similar to one as well. The kukri is unique in that it requires strength to wield over dexterity, but the weight and forward angled edge give devestating wounds in the hands of a master.

##### Rapier
The rapier is a long, thin sword designed with extra weight in the handle for maximum control with the tip. Prized as the pinnacle of finesse, masters learn how to properly strike forth in a lunge, learn expert parries, and use a rapier in the off hand.

||
|:--|:--|
| Simple | One Handed, Melee d6, Awkward |
| Martial | One Handed, Melee d8, Finesse, Light |
| Master | One Handed, Melee d8, Deflect, Finesse, Light, Lunge |
| Master Perk | If you are wielding a rapier and nothing in your off hand, you can add d4 to your damage roll. If you are wielding a light weapon, instead add +1 to AC.|


##### Saber
A saber describes a wide variety of weapons that all share a few properties in common; one-handed, single-edged, slight curve, and little or no counterweight to add cutting power to the blades. Examples are the cavalry saber, shamshir, and officer’s sword. The master finds the saber’s curve and hand protection give incredible defense.

||
|:--|:--|
| Simple | One Handed, Melee d6, Awkward |
| Martial | One Handed, Melee d8, Deflect, Finesse |
| Master | One Handed, Melee 2d4, Deflect, Finesse, Light |
| Master Perk | If an enemy hits you with a melee weapon attack, you can use your reaction to add your proficiency to your AC, possibly negating a successful hit. This added bonus to AC lasts for that enemy's turn only. |

##### Sai
A sai is a dagger sized weapon made famous in Okinawa, which consists of a sharpened metal rod with two forward swept, elongated prongs for a hand guard, making it easy to block and trap enemy weapons, but this template can be used for any parrying dagger designed primarily to block. Since only the tip is sharpened, the sai suffers from damage capability and versatility, but is easily the best light weapon for the duelist looking for a bit of protection. The master uses the parrying prongs to disarm blindingly fast, and even gains a passive protection from their stance.

||

| Martial | One Handed, Melee d4, Conceal, Deflect, Finesse, Light |
| Master | One Handed, Melee d4, Conceal, Deflect, Disarm, Finesse, Light |
| Master Perk | You gain +1 AC if you are wielding a Sai in your off hand and you can perform a disarm attack as a reaction when an enemy misses you with a melee weapon attack. |

```
```


##### Shortsword
This category consists of any thrusting or chopping blade longer than a dagger, but shorter than a full-sized sword. Examples include a cutlass, wakizashi, or machete. The master learns to gain every bit of damage out of the shortsword.

||
|:--|:--|
| Simple | One Handed, Melee d6, Finesse, Light |
| Martial | One Handed, Melee d6, Finesse, Light |
| Master | One Handed, Melee d8, Finesse, Light |
| Master Perk | When you have advantage on the attack, you can roll damage twice and take the better result, including any attachers, such as elemental imbue damage or sneak attacks. |

##### Sickle
The sickle is a short, crescent-shaped blade with the cutting edge on the inside of the curve, derived from the farming tool designed to harvest plants. The crescent can be used to trip a target, and a master learns to use the curve of the weapon to grapple and bind enemies when the point sinks into a target.

| Master Perk | Your entangle attacks deal full weapon damage on hit. When you hit with a trip attack, your enemy suffers -10 ft to its speed until the end of its next turn, regardless of if it succeeds on the save against the trip. |

##### Smallsword
The smallsword is a light weapon designed for thrusting which evolved out of the longer and heavier rapier. It has a triangular profile and often a pistol grip, giving the fullest control over the tip over any other weapon design. The master has such control over the thrusting tip, they can negate a detriment to their attack with focus.

It doesn't have disadvantage and gains Penetrate when an enemy is within 5ft, but can only attack one target at this range. A master overpacks his weapon to great effect. 

When you make an attack, you choose a target and up to 2 targets within 5ft of it. One shot rolls one attack against all three targets together. A blunderbuss does not have a long range.

### Feat: Flail and Whip Master
- +1 to attack rolls with flails and whips
- As a bonus action, you add +2 to attack using your flail or whip against an enemy for this turn, as you sweep around the shield or guard to hit. 
- When you hit with an opportunity attack, the foe must succeed on a strength saving throw or be knocked prone
- You gain advantage on any attack made to attempt a Trip, Disarm, or Entangle, and if both dice rolls would have hit, the enemy takes full damage as if you attacked them normally in addition to needing to make the save. 

##### Double Flail
This flail has two flail heads, each with a separate chain attached to a single handle, whether they are attached at opposing ends, or attached at the same end. The Double flail is a difficult weapon to use effectively, and only the master really gets use out of individual heads, turning a potential miss into a new opportunity.

| Master Perk | When you suffer disadvantage but one dice would have hit, you deal 1 of the weapon's damage dice plus your strength modfier, <br>even though this still counts <br>as a miss. If you <br>have advantage <br>and both dice hit, <br>add your Strength <br>modifier twice to the<br> damage total. |
```
```
##### Light Flail
The familiar handle with a spiked ball at the end of a chain which deals both bludgeoning and piercing damage at the same time for the purposes of overcoming resistances or immunities. Masters with the light flail learns to carry the weapons speed and momentum into another attack if they miss.

##### Heavy Flail
A heavy flail consists of a long handle with a large spiked metal bar like the end of a morningstar, which is attached by means of chain or swivel. The heavy flail is an immense weapon, but the master learns to wield it one-handed, and can turn a failed trip or disarm attempt into a strike that still damages.

| Master Perk | If the enemy succeeds on the save after your trip or disarm attack hits, you may make a free attack as part of the same action. |


##### Pole Flail
A weapon of hafted reach, though instead of an axe or blade, there is the spiked bar of the heavy flail, which deals bludgeoning and piercing damage at the same time. The pole flail is primarily designed for field warfare, thought the master learns to bind and damage knees and ankles just out of reach, causing massive damage to fleeing targets. 

||

| Simple | Two Handed, Melee d10, Awkward, Heavy, Reach |
| Martial | Two Handed, Melee d10, Heavy, Reach, Trip |
| Master | Two Handed, Melee d10, Entangle, Heavy, Reach, Trip |
| Master Perk | When you hit with an opportunity attack, that creature's speed is halved until the end of its next turn. |


##### Meteor Hammer
This weapon is a spherical or conical weight attached to a 15-foot rope. Used as a more brutal form of a rope dart, the meteor hammer is capable of using circular movement to strike or bind, and using explosive lunges to strike at a distance. A master can twirl the weapon around them with varying angles and speed to strike any foe who enters their reach from any direction.

| Martial | Two Handed, Melee d4, Entangle, Finesse, Lunge, Reach |

| Master Perk | As an action, you begin twirling the hammer around you in a 10ft radius. Until the start of your next turn, any creature of your choice which starts its turn or which enters this space must succeed on a Dexterity save or take d4 plus your choice of strength or dexterity modifier in bludgeoning damage.|

```
##### Nunchaku
Made famous in Okinawa, the nunchaku is two rods bound by a rope or chain. By whipping around the body, it can make dizzyingly fast attacks, and despite being a one handed weapon, a master can wield it like a Double Ended weapon.  

||
|:--|:--|

| Martial | One Handed, Melee d4, Conceal, Entangle, Finesse, Light, Trip |
| Master | One Handed, Melee d4, Conceal, Double Ended d4, Entangle, Finesse, Light, Trip |
| Master Perk | You can treat this weapon as if it is Double Ended even while wielding it in one hand. If you dual wield nunchaku, you may make two Double Ended attacks with the same Bonus Action. If you wield only one, you gain Disarm. |


##### Whip
The whip is treated as a melee weapon with 15ft reach. You can use a whip to grasp unattended small objects, or any reasonable handhold within range and if possible, you can pull the object to you. A whip master has such control over his grasping whip, he can manipulate objects at will.  

||
|:--|:--|
| Simple | One Handed, Melee d2, Awkward, Finesse |
| Martial | One Handed, Melee d4, Disarm, Finesse, Reach (15ft) |
| Master | One Handed, Melee d6, Disarm, Entangle, Finesse, Light, Reach (15ft), Trip |
| Master Perk | When you disarm any creature, you choose to place the item anywhere in your reach, or catch it as a reaction. An item in your reach that can be grabbed with the whip can be placed anywhere else in your reach. |

##### Chain Sword
The most exotic weapon in the group, a chain sword can be both a sword or a bladed whip. As a bonus action, you change between the forms of your weapon. As a sword, it is similar in size and shape to a longsword. As a whip, it gains some reach and utility, and a target entangled by you takes your weapon's full damage. A master can quickly change between forms as needed and even attack targets adjacent to his entangled foe. 

||Sword Form|

| Master Perk | You may change between weapon forms freely, which is how you get the lunge property. |

||Whip Form
|:--|:--|
| Simple | One Handed, Melee d4, Awkward, Reach |
| Martial | One Handed, Melee d6, Entangle, Finesse, Reach |
| Master | One Handed, Melee d6, Entangle, Finesse, Reach |

### Feat: Hammer and Pick Master
- +1 to attack rolls made with hammers or picks
- Whenever you have advantage on attacks and both dice would hit, you knock the target prone or shove them 5ft
- Whenever you have disadvantage on attacks and at least one roll would have hit but the other misses, you can deal your strength modifier in weapon damage to the target. 

##### Light Hammer
The light hammer is a short-handled, blunt warhammer balanced for throwing. While a flanged mace may shred armor, a hammer is able to more precisely deliver blows that weaken the bearer of that armor, and a master can even weaken a user enough that movement seems impossible.

| Master Perk | If your attack is at least 5 higher than <br>the AC, your enemy's speed is reduced <br>by half until the start of your next turn.|

##### War Hammer
The historical warhammer was a lightweight, <br>long-handled weapon designed to damage <br>armored enemies. The small, pronged hammer <br>head is often backed with a military pick or <br>different style of face. A master of the warhammer <br>cares little for armor, blasting through it with ease.

##### Maul
The maul is a massive weapon; a great hammer able to move the stoutest of foes. The weapon’s weight adds to its damage, and the master finds he can use the weapon’s mass to smash foes to the ground or send them flying. Additionally, a maul always has advantage on attack rolls to damage objects.

| Master Perk |If you move at least 10 ft before making an attack, you gain +5 bonus to the attack's damage roll and your shove attacks knock foes 10 ft and prone instead of 5 ft or prone.|


##### Lucerne
This hammer polearm has a pronged hammer head for crushing blows on one side and a spiked hook head for piercing and peeling armor on the other. The long haft allows the wielder to put devastating force behind the blows of this weapon. Lucerne masters learn to destroy shields and armor with relative ease.

| Martial |Two Handed, Melee 2d6, Brace, Heavy, Penetrate, Reach, Trip|
| Master |Two Handed, Melee 2d6, Brace, Heavy, Penetrate, Reach, Trip|
| Master Perk |As an action, you roll an attack to destroy the shield or armor worn by the enemy. On a hit, your enemy must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or their AC is reduced by 2. If they succeed on this save, they instead take damage. |


##### Light Pick
The light pick is a smaller version of the war pick, with a thinner point and shorter length for one handed wielding. Though not as stout and easily able to puncture armor like the war pick, the light pick allows more agile maneuvers, as well as balanced throwing. A master has learned to look for the perfect opening, placing the pick into soft targets in armor.

| Master Perk |You have +2 to attacks against any enemy wearing armor.|

<div class='toc'>

```
```

##### Wall Pick
A wall pick is also called a climbing pick, and has been repurposed for combat. It is similar in size to the light pick, though has a longer spike at a more hooked angle to aid in climbing. In combat, this can be used to great effect to grapple an opponent or disarm them quite easily. While using a wall pick, you have advantage on climb checks. The master can grapple a foe as easily as they latch onto a wall. While wielding a climbing pick, you can climb creatures two size categories bigger than you and hold onto them.

| Master |One Handed, Melee d8, Finesse, Thrown (20/60), Disarm, Entangle, Light, Penetrate, Trip|
| Master Perk |You have advantage on attack rolls made to entangle, and if both dice would have hit, your enemy has the restrained and grappled condition.|

##### War Pick
The war pick is a weapon derived from a miner's pick, famously manufactured by militant mountain dwarves, but has since been refined and used worldwide by militaries facing heavily armored combatants. The pick comes in many forms but is usually a battle axe sized weapon with a reinforced spike on one end, and a widened, sharpened scoop or hammer opposite the spike. A master learns to puncture in vital areas to bleed the foe over time with deep stab wounds.

| Master |One Handed, Melee d10, Penetrate, Trip|
| Master Perk |You can choose to take -5 to your attack roll, and if successful, your target takes piercing damage equal to your strength modifier at the start of each of their turns. A creature can attempt a Constitution saving throw at the end of their turn, ending the effect on a success. If the creature receives any healing, this also ends the effect.|

##### Stiletto
The stiletto is a long, thin, needle-like dagger made for puncturing armor with ease. Its thin point and narrow cross section make it perfect for fitting between armor plates, or outright puncturing through them so deeply it allows the user to stab and hold an enemy. A master has learned to use the needle-point with such accuracy that his foes may as well not even be wearing armor.

### Feat: Polearm Master
- +1 to attack rolls with polearms
- All Polearm weapons are treated as having the Double Ended property. Your normal attacks are made with the weapon's damage die, while your attack with Double Ended is made with d4, unless stated otherwise. 
- While you are wielding the polearm, other creatures provoke an opportunity attack from you when they enter the reach of your weapon.

##### Glaive
Perhaps the simplest of the polearms, a glaive is a sword blade, usually about 36-40 inches mounted on a 4-6 foot pole, creating a 6-8 foot weapon. A Glaive can be used like a spear or like a greatsword, and the wide, sweeping slashes deal extra damage to creatures much bigger than the wielder. Sometimes referred to as a horse killer, the Glaive was originally designed to be used by infantry against cavalry, but in the hands of a master adventurer, can be used quite effectively as a giant killer.

##### Guisarme
A guisarme is a modified pruning hook, developed as a peasant weapon from modifying a farm tool. The curved hook of the blade allows the guisarme to be used as a tripping weapon or to pull foes from the saddle. With at least martial proficiency, a Guisarme can be used to perform a trip against mounted foes to pull them from the saddle to a prone position. Guisarme masters get advantage on trip maneuvers.

||
|:--|:--|
| Simple |Two Handed, Melee d8, Brace, Reach, Trip, Heavy|
| Martial |Two Handed, Melee d10, Brace, Reach, Trip, Heavy|
| Master |Two handed, Melee d10, Brace, Reach, Trip, Heavy|
| Master Perk |You have advantage on trip attacks made to targets at 10ft away from you, and if you succeed against a mounted foe, it is automatically pulled from its mount to a prone position without making any additional saves. When you successfully hit with a trip attack, its speed is reduced by 10ft until the end of its next turn, regardless of whether it succeeded on the save.|


##### Lajatang
A lajatang is a rare and unusual Double Ended weapon. It consists of a three to five foot shaft with a crescent blade fitted at each end with the points faced away from the center of the weapon. The rare masters are a whirling dervish of blade and crescent points, dangerous from all sides.  

||

| Simple |Two Handed, Melee d6, Awkward, Brace, Reach|
| Martial |Two Handed, Melee d8, Double Ended d8, Brace, Finesse, Reach|
| Master |Two Handed, Melee d10, Double Ended d10, Brace, Finesse, Reach|
| Master Perk |You negate any effect an enemy might gain from flanking or having the enemy's ally near you, including bonuses such as Pack Tactics or Sneak Attack. In addition, you make two attacks with Double Ended instead of the usual one, however your second attack from Double Ended must choose a different target than the first.|


##### Partisan
A partisan is much like a Glaive in that the design is essentially a sword blade mounted to a long shaft. However, the partisan retains the sword's guard, and is very effective at protection from range, though the guard prevents it from making sweeping, cleaving cuts like the glaive. The Master Partisan uses the guard of his weapon with great effect at a distance. 

||
|:--|:--|
| Simple |Two Handed, Melee d10, Awkward, Brace, Reach, Heavy|
| Martial |Two Handed, Melee 2d6, Brace, Reach, Heavy|
| Master |Two Handed, Melee 2d6, Brace, Reach, Lunge, Heavy|
| Master Perk |You have +2AC against melee attacks from enemies that are 10ft away from you. When an enemy targets an ally within 5ft of you, you can use your reaction to <br>impose disadvantage <br>to that attack. |



##### War Scythe
Whether mounted horizontally like a traditional farming implement, or mounted vertically like a glaive, a war scythe has its roots in a peasant militia looking to arm itself in times of war. A scythe in the right hands can be useful in combat, though it takes a practiced user to be truly effective. The master uses the scythe's reaping motion to deal horrible slashing wounds to the foes he trips in combat.

||
|:--|:--|
| Simple |Two Handed, Melee 2d6, Heavy, Penetrate, Reach, Trip |
| Martial |Two Handed, Melee 2d6, Heavy, Entangle, Penetrate, Reach, Trip|
| Master |Two handed, Melee 2d8, Heavy, Entangle, Penetrate, Reach, Trip|
| Master Perk |When you successfully trip an enemy, that enemy takes full weapon damage, and has its speed reduced to just 10ft until the end of its next turn. |


> ##### Mounted Combat Reminder
> Remember the following while fighting mounted combatants!
>- If an effect moves a mount against its will, the rider must succeed on a DC10 Dexterity saving throw, or fall off the mount, landing prone within 5ft of it
>- If the rider is knocked prone while in the saddle, it must also make this save
>- If the mount is knocked prone, the rider can use its reaction to land safely on its feet within 5ft of the prone mount, otherwise it too falls prone. 
>
> Therefore, when you attempt a trip attack against a mounted foe and succeed, the foe can still succeed on a different save and stay in the saddle while the mount whisks them away to safety!

### Feat: Spear Master
- +1 to attacks rolls made with spears
- You may lunge with any spear, which does <br>not use your reaction
- Once per turn, if you have advantage on an <br>attack roll, you can forgo the advantage for that <br>roll to make an additional weapon attack against that target, as part of the same action. Any remaining attacks still have advantage.

##### Godendag
A godendag is a short spear from Western Europe with a thick socket holding the point, heavy enough to use as a bludgeon. The style of fighting with a godendag involves swinging and thrusting, both utilizing the spear's weighted head and pointed tip in combat. A master can stun his foe, and even uses the weapon's weight to trip or disarm.

| Simple |Two Handed, Melee d6, Thrown (10/40), Awkward, Penetrate|
| Martial |Two Handed, Melee d6, Thrown (20/60), Penetrate, Trip|
| Master |Two Handed, Melee d8, Disarm, Thrown (30/120), Penetrate, Trip|
| Master Perk | Before you attack, you can choose to take -5 to the roll. If you hit, your foe must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be stunned until the end of your next turn. |


##### Javelin
The javelin is a light throwing spear built with low weight <br>and balance for flight. It generally has a long spear point that can break off in a shield or armor, rendering the user much less agile, and the master has learned to do so reliably, targetting a shield to intentionally break the javelin off in it.

||
|:--|:--|
| Simple |One Handed, Melee d6, Thrown (20/60), Light|
| Martial |One Handed, Melee d6, Thrown (30/120), Light|
| Master |One Handed, Melee d8, Thrown (30/240), Light|
| Master Perk | Before the attack, you can take -5 to your attack roll. If you hit, your enemy can no longer use their shield until they use an action to pry the remnants of the javelin from the shield itself.|

##### Harpoon
A barbed throwing spear with a welded ring, attached to a length of rope or chain so the target or harpoon can be retrieved. A master of the harpoon impales with ease and can swiftly reel in a harpooned prey. 

Each hit, your enemy must succeed on a strength saving throw or be impaled, while a critical hit always impales. 

||
|:--|:--|
| Simple |Two Handed, Melee d6, Thrown (10/40), Awkward, Light|
| Martial |Two Handed, Melee d6, Thrown (20/60), Light|
| Master |One Handed, Melee d8, Penetrate, Thrown (30/120), Light |
| Master Perk |You may drag an enemy back to you at twice your climbing speed, and enemies have disadvantage Strength saving throws. |

>##### Harpoon Retrieval
> When an enemy is impaled, you can spend a bonus action to pull it toward you a number of feet equal to your climbing speed, if you win an Athletics contest with the enemy on your turn. On its turn, to move away from you, it must win an Athletics contest.  While impaled, your enemy takes damage from your weapon at the start of its turn.
>
> If you harpoon an enemy at least two size categories larger than you, you simply move with your target and climb the rope as normal Your enemy can spend an action to repeat the save to pull the weapon free. If your harpoon is free or you miss, you can retrieve it at twice your climb speed on your turn as a bonus action.


##### Lance
Designed for mounted use, a lance imposes disadvantage on attacks against targets within 5ft while on foot. While mounted, you gain Penetrate. Masters with the lance hold it steady, leveraging the mount's strength into the attack. 

||
|:--|:--|
| Simple |Two Handed Melee d8, Awkward, Brace, Reach|
| Martial |Two Handed Melee d12, Brace, Reach |
| Master |One Handed, Melee 2d8, Brace, Reach |
| Master Perk |While mounted, each attack is also a shove attempt, and you have advantage in the contest.|

##### Pike
The pike is an 8-12 ft spear designed for infantry in a phalanx formation against an opposing line. A master with the Pike learns to fight as a phalanx soldier, using their ally as cover, deftly striking around them without detriment.

||
|:--|:--|
| Simple |Two Handed, Melee d8, Brace, Heavy, Reach|
| Martial |Two Handed, Melee d12, Brace, Heavy, Lunge, Reach|
| Master |Two Handed, Melee 2d8, Brace, Heavy, Lunge, Reach |
| Master Perk |No creature gives half cover to your enemy while at reach. Your allies still provide half cover to you.|

##### War Spear
A war spear is different from a simple spear in that it is designed to resist cutting its shaft, and has weight in the pommel, making it more balanced for martial techniques while paired with a shield. A war spear can be used as a throwing weapon, but not as effectively as a javelin.

||
|:--|:--|
| Simple |Two Handed, Melee d8, Awkward|
| Martial |One Handed, Melee d8, Thrown (20/60), Double Ended d4, Finesse, Versatile d10|
| Master |One Handed, Melee d10, Thrown (30/120), Double Ended d4, Finesse, Versatile d12|
| Master Perk |If you hit the same target twice in a row, your second hit deals an extra d6 damage. As long as you continue to hit the same target, even between turns, you deal the extra damage. If you ever miss or change targets you must start this process over. |

##### Ravenbeak
A ravenbeak is a spear that looks similar to a warspear but has a crescent shaped hook on one side of the tip, which can be used to hook or slash. The hook is often sharpened and can be devastating if used properly. A master is an expert at manipulating the enemy with the hook and tip.

||
|:--|:--|
| Simple |Two Handed, Melee d8, Brace, Heavy, Reach, Trip |
| Martial |Two Handed, Melee d8, Brace, Entangle, Heavy, Lunge, Reach, Trip |
| Master |Two Handed, Melee d8, Brace, Disarm, Entangle, Heavy, Lunge, Reach, Trip |
| Master Perk |While at reach, you ignore any shield AC. Additionally, your disarm attacks deal full weapon damage if the enemy fails the saving throw.|

##### Trident
Traditionally a fishing tool, the trident can be repurposed for war with some modification. Three prongs deal more reliable damage than a simple spear, and can trap and bind weapons. The master trident user finds particularly devastating attacks while throwing it, and can disarm with ease.

||
|:--|:--|
| Simple |One Handed, Melee d6, Awkward|
| Martial |One Handed, Melee d8, Disarm, Thrown (20/60), Versatile 2d4|
| Master |One Handed, Melee d12, Deflect 3d4, Disarm, Thrown (30/120), Versatile 3d4|
| Master Perk |If you hit with a Thrown attack, the enemy must succeed on a Strength saving throw or their speed is reduced by half until they use an action to remove it. If an enemy misses you with a melee weapon attack, you may use your reaction to attempt a disarm attack. |

### Feat: Throwing Weapon Master
- You may throw anything with proficiency. Additionally, when you throw with your off hand, you add your ability modifier to the damage roll.
- Throwing a weapon ignores half cover.
- You threaten 10ft around you and can make a ranged Opportunity Attack if an enemy leaves your threatened space. 
- You do not suffer disadvantage to ranged attacks at long range and do not suffer disadvantage to ranged attacks made while an enemy is within 5ft of you.

##### Bolas
A bolas is a pair of weights, connected by a thin rope <br>or cord reinforced with metal links to prevent the <br>prey from simply biting or tearing the bolas to escape. <br>The master bolo learns to accurately target his prey,<br> bringing them down by binding the legs. 

A bolas has an AC of 15 and 2HP and is immune to bludgeoning damage. When your enemy succeeds at a<br> save to escape or reduces the bolas to 0hp, it is destroyed.

| Master Perk | On a hit, you deal your weapon's normal <br>damage and your enemy must succeed on<br> a save against both an Entangle and Trip. |


##### Boomerang
 A hooked piece of hardwood or metal, curved in a way which provides lift. Every time you make a ranged attack the weapon returns to you. Additionally, the weapon is stout enough to use in melee, and the master can curve the weapon to hit more than one target at a time. 

||
|:--|:--|
| Simple |One Handed, Melee d6, Thrown (30/120), Awkward, Light|

##### Chakram
The chakram is an elegant and highly portable thrown weapon. It is a flat, open-centered metal discus with a sharpened edge.  This weapon returns to you like a boomerang if your target is within normal range. Dangerous from all angles, the master can react quickly, throwing or slashing as a reaction to someone missing the mark. 

||
|:--|:--|
| Simple |One Handed, Melee d4, Thrown (20/60), Awkward, Light|
| Martial |One Handed, Melee d6, Thrown (40/120), Finesse, Light|
| Master |One Handed, Melee d8, Thrown (80/500), Finesse, Light|
| Master Perk |If a creature misses you with a ranged or melee attack, you can use your reaction to make a ranged or melee attack against that creature. |


##### Dart
More similar to a lawn dart than a pub dart, this throwing weapon is smaller than a javelin, typically fletched like an arrow and weighted with lead. It’s superior piercing capability and weighted tip allow the master to pin targets to walls if the conditions are right.

||
|:--|:--|
| Simple |One Handed, Thrown d4, (20/60), Conceal Finesse, Light, Penetrate|
| Martial |One Handed, Thrown d4, (30/60), Conceal Finesse,  Light, Penetrate|
| Master |One Handed, Thrown d6, (60/120), Conceal Finesse, Light, Penetrate|
| Master Perk |When you land a hit, you can choose to deal no damage and instead pin the enemy to an adjacent wall or obstacle such as a tree or boulder. Your enemy is restrained, the escape DC is your weapon DC. |


##### Net
A net is used to entangle enemies. A large or smaller creature hit by a net is restrained until freed. Dealing 5 slashing damage to the net (AC10) also frees the creature without harming it, ending the effect and destroying the net. A normal net cannot be used against category size Huge or larger enemies, but larger nets can be made at four times the cost and weight which can target Huge targets, while a net for gargantuan targets may not be able to be made with normal materials or wielded by a medium creature.

| Simple |Two handed, Thrown (5ft), Awkward.|
| Martial |Two Handed, Thrown (10ft) Entangle|
| Master |One Handed, Thrown (15ft), Deflect d6, Entangle, Light, Trip|
| Master Perk |If you have advantage when you entangle your enemy, it has disadvantage on the check made to escape.|

<div class='toc'>
- ##### [<span></span><span>Return to Top</span>](#p2)

```
```

##### Throwing Shot
An Orcish invention, the throwing Shot is a heavy iron ball used offensively as a thrown weapon. A creature must take time to wind up and throw the shot, and even aloft it cannot travel as far as other throwing weapons. However, such a heavy weapon in flight is fearsome; not many can stand up to the impact. A master is deadly accurate with the shot and is able to target an enemy's head to stun them with ease.  A creature with Strength less than 13 cannot wield a shot at all. 

||
|:--|:--|
| Simple |Two Handed, Thrown d8 (10ft) Awkward, Penetrate|
| Martial |Two Handed, Thrown d10 (20/60), Penetrate, Trip|
| Master |One Handed, Thrown d12 (30/90), Disarm, Penetrate, Trip|
| Master Perk |If you have advantage and both dice would have hit, or if you score a critical hit, your enemy is stunned until the end of its next turn. If you have disadvantage but one dice would have hit, deal your strength modifier in damage to the target, though this still counts as a miss. |



##### Throwing Star
These small pointed disks are constructed from thin, flat plates of metal derived from a variety of sources including coins, carpentry tools, washers or nail removers. They often have a hole in the center and sharpened tips in a concentric pattern. The flat, small design of these weapons allows many to be palmed at once and thrown all together.


||
|:--|:--|
| Simple |One Handed, Thrown d4 (10/30), Conceal, Finesse, Light|
| Martial |One Handed, Thrown d4 (20/60), Conceal, Finesse, Light|
| Master |One Handed, Thrown d4 (40/120), Conceal, Finesse, Light|
| Master Perk |As an Action, you can force all targets of your choice in a 15ft cone to succeed on a Dexterity Saving Throw or suffer d4 plus your choice of Strength or Dexterity modifier in piercing damage. You throw as many stars as there are valid targets.|


##### Throwing Knife
These pocket knives are much smaller than any dagger, and resemble more utility or paring knives than real weapons. However, they can be easily hidden, and offer more range when thrown due to slightly more balanced weight. A master has the capability to dance in a quick circle, throwing knives at all foes around him, though this leaves him open to attack.


||

| Simple |One Handed, Melee d4, Thrown (10/30), Awkward, Conceal, Finesse, Light|

| Master |One Handed, Melee d4, Thrown (40/120), Conceal, Finesse, Light|
| Master Perk | As an action, you can force all targets of your choice within 10ft to succeed on a Dexterity Saving Throw or take d4 plus your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier in piercing damage. You throw as many knives as there are valid targets.|

## Magic Spell and Ability Interactions with RME

There are some magic spells which produce a weapon, or weapon-like quality that the caster can use offensively like a normal melee weapon. It is important to clearly detail how this system interacts with those spells, and to what extent these summoned effects benefit from Weapon Properties from Revised Martial Equipment. You are considered Master trained with any weapon summoned with these spells, but their properties and master perks are listed below, different from the weapons which they resemble. 

### Melee Weapon Spells
**Flame Blade** - This spell summons any Combat Blade or Dueling Blade with the One Handed property that lacks Versatile. Its properties are only Finesse and Light. The Master Perk is now: The weapon deals fire damage and it sheds light half as bright as a torch.
<div style='margin-top:0px'></div>


**Shadow Blade** - This spell summons any Combat Blade or Dueling Blade with the One Handed property that lacks Versatile. Its properties are only Finesse, Light, and Thrown (20/60) using the damage value appropriate for the level of the spell. 

Master Perk: the weapon deals Psychic damage and grants advantage on your attack rolls when your target is in dim light or darkness. 
<div style='margin-top:0px'></div>

**Spiritual Weapon** - This spell summons a floating spectral weapon which cannot be wielded. It gains no weapon properties, nor can it be attacked or used to attack even by the caster. It is essentially a vehicle for Bonus action force damage. 
<div style='margin-top:0px'></div>

**Shillelagh** - This spell can be used on any Bludgeon weapon, but its damage is d8, even if the weapon would normally have a better damage die. However, this damage does extend to Double Ended. 

Master Perk: Your weapon damage is now magical. 
<div style='margin-top:0px'></div>

**Tenser's Transformation** - This spell does all it says in its description. When you cast this spell, you choose a weapon, shield, or armor group and gain Master training with all equipment in that group. You do not gain the Master feat for that group unless you already have it. When this spell ends, you lose the training in whichever group you chose.
<div style='margin-top:0px'></div>

**Mordenkainen's Sword** - This spell summons a sword-shaped plane of force that can assume any Combat Blade or Dueling Blade's shape. However, this weapon cannot be wielded, and gains no weapon properties. 
<div style='margin-top:0px'></div>

**Steel Wind Strike** - You gain Master training with the weapon you chose as the material component for the duration of this spell. 

Master Perk: You can teleport to an unoccupied space you can see within 5 feet of one of the targets you hit or missed.

```
```

### Ranged Weapon Spells
**Swift Quiver** - You do not gain master training for the weapon which uses this ammunition, but this spell can be used on any ammunition and any container for which ammunition is stored, such as a pouch, bolt case, or spinner cartridge. The ammunition and container gain all the effects of the spell. However, the weapon for which the ammunition is used must still be reloaded, using the time as is appropriate for the training level you are at with the weapon for which this ammunition is used.
<div style='margin-top:0px'></div>

**Conjure Barrage** - This spell can be used on any ammunition or weapon with the Thrown property. The weapons or ammunition that are conjured lose any Weapon Properties or Master Perks they have prior to the spell and deal only 3d8 damage appropriate to the type of damage for the weapon or ammunition used. 
<div style='margin-top:0px'></div>

**Conjure Volley** - This spell can be used on any ammunition or weapon with the Thrown property. The weapons or ammunition that are conjured lose any Weapon Properties or Master Perks they have prior to the spell, and the spell continues as normal for its description.
<div style='margin-top:0px'></div>

**Cordon of Arrows** - This spell may be used on any ammunition or weapon with the Thrown property. The weapon loses any Weapon Properties it has, and deals only 1d6 damage of the type appropriate for the weapon and it is destroyed when the spell's effects occur. 

### Other
**Artificer Infusion: Returning Weapon** - This Infusion can be used on any weapon with the Thrown property. 
<div style='margin-top:0px'></div>

**Artificer Infusion: Repeating Shot** - This Infusion can be used on any weapon with the Reload property. When you reload this weapon, reduce its reload time by one step, e.g. if a weapon with your current training as Reload as a Bonus Action, you can choose to Reload as a Reaction. This is the effect of your ammunition teleporting back into place in your ranged weapon, but you must still manually prime the weapon for attack.
